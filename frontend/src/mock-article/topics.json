      "needs_further_processing": false,
      "new_information": "Critical power outages on the Iberian Peninsula highlight Europe's dependence on its electricity grids. The recent outages in Spain and Portugal, caused by abnormal fluctuations in high-voltage lines, made it clear that regional interdependence can be both a strength and a weakness. With peak demand of 27,500 MW in Spain, largely covered by solar, wind, and natural gas, and stable demand of 8,000 MW in Portugal, the role of renewable sources is significant. However, problems with coordinated management and sudden disconnections from networks, as happened with France, illustrate the vulnerabilities of this structure. Experts point to the need for stronger domestic resilience and better regional coordination to prevent larger disasters in the future. The call for improved grid infrastructures across Europe is growing louder. The complex nature of European power grids can be compared to a game of dominoes. A disruption in one part of the grid can cause a chain reaction that leads to problems in various regions. This was recently demonstrated during the massive power outage in Spain and Portugal on April 28, 2025, when the disconnection of the Spanish network from France proved crucial. Spain and Portugal, located on the edge of the European electricity grid, have limited connections to the wider European network, making these countries particularly vulnerable to disruptions. These geographical and infrastructural limitations, combined with abnormal temperature fluctuations in the region, contributed to the power outage. The Dutch demonstrator of the eFORT project is developing a digital twin of the grid to increase its resilience to cyber attacks. With the increasing use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy in Spain, the balance of electricity grids is becoming increasingly complex. During peak demand of 27,500 MW, Spain became largely dependent on these intermittent energy sources. While renewable energy makes a positive contribution to sustainability, it also introduces vulnerabilities due to the unpredictability of generation. These conditions require advanced management strategies to effectively balance shortages and surpluses, which proved unsuccessful in the case of the recent incidents. The interconnectivity of European electricity grids is often praised as a way to efficiently share energy surpluses and quickly compensate for shortages. TenneT, the Dutch grid operator, emphasizes that complete decoupling can make the grid more vulnerable to disruptions. Shared resources can act as a safety net, as demonstrated in the Netherlands, where decentralized connections and international links minimize outages. However, the vulnerability lies in scenarios where unexpected disconnections, such as the safety protocols that shut down France's interconnectors, lead to large-scale disruptions. During the recent power outage, France's automatic safety protocols triggered the shutdown of interconnectors, leading to the isolation of the Iberian Peninsula. This response, designed to prevent further disruptions, highlighted a paradox in which safety measures led to greater regional problems. While France had relatively better control of the existing problem, Spain was left with a deficit of more than 10,000 MW after the forced network disconnections. Such situations highlight the need for improved cross-regional coordination and flexibility in network design. Recent events are a wake-up call for the review of current network strategies and infrastructures in Europe. The importance of more robust domestic networks and strategic planning to reduce dependence on cross-border flows is clear. There are calls for investment in smart grid technologies and improved storage capabilities to absorb peaks and ensure stability in times of crisis. The case of Spain and Portugal is an urgent example of European countries integrating resilience into their energy infrastructure for a more secure future. Renewables provide 53% of the Dutch electricity production in the first half of 2024.",

Cure works with a new procedure in which a warning letter is first sent, and only in the event of a repeat the costs are recovered from the ‘perpetrator’. The reason for the new method is limited effectiveness on the part of the municipality. According to the City Council, civil servants of Beroep en Bezwaar (appeals and objections) department can ‘process a maximum of sixty notices per month, which is why the warning letter is used as a lighter means to tackle the problem on a larger scale’. At the request of SP (socialist party) fraction, Eindhoven City Council will be updated on the new method at the beginning of May. According to the fraction, the new method appears to be susceptible to fraud and enforcement is ‘pre-eminently a task for the municipality’. ‘People can ‘trick’ other people by putting a false address in an extra garbage bag; victims must then take action through an objection procedure to try to rectify this’, the fraction writes in the agenda request.

      "new_information": "The Netherlands faces a critical issue of drinking water scarcity, exacerbated by increasing demand and inadequate conservation progress, concludes the Dutch Court of Audit in a report released today. Despite targets to reduce household water consumption to 100 liters per person per day by 2035 and business usage reduction goals, the court questions the efficacy of these plans. Contributing factors include increased business water consumption and uncertainty over the impact of proposed national awareness campaigns. In recent years, the Netherlands saw an uptick in its water consumption demands, placing pressure on its water resources. The supply shortages are alarming in provinces such as Gelderland, Overijssel, West Holland, and Groningen, where high demand has often outpaced available resources during peak periods. Anticipating future needs, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has forecasted a requirement of an additional 102 million cubic meters of drinking water by 2030, compared to the levels in 2020. The Dutch government has set ambitious goals to curb water consumption, targeting a household reduction from 119 liters to 100 liters per capita per day by 2035. Similarly, it aims for a 20% decrease in business water usage from levels recorded between 2016 and 2019. These targets clash with the soaring need for water, compelling the Dutch Court of Audit to doubt the feasibility of achieving the cabinet’s objectives. Efforts to enforce water-saving measures face significant challenges. Researchers question the potential impact of national awareness campaigns proposed by Minister Madlener of Infrastructure and Water Management, intended to generate 'water awareness' among the population. Moreover, a sluggish pace in adopting technical solutions, such as mandatory rainwater or greywater systems in new buildings, adds to these difficulties. The anticipated delay in implementing such requirements means many homes will have been constructed without these systems by the time regulations take effect, notes the court. To address the crisis, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management is embarking on major initiatives, including introducing a National Action Plan for Drinking Water Savings in June 2024 and an Action Program for the Availability of Drinking Water Sources from 2023 to 2030. These strategies aim to incrementally increase resources for drinking water companies and adapt policies to meet long-term demand. Innovative solutions developed in the Netherlands are emerging. Hydraloop, a water recycling system, demonstrates significant potential to cut domestic water use by up to 45% by reusing greywater for non-potable applications like toilet flushing and gardening. However, the adoption of such new technologies requires a shift in public perspective on water usage. Similarly, Ferr-Tech's Ferrate(VI) technology offers an effective means to treat industrial waste water, showcasing how sustainable practices can make a substantial environmental impact. The industry can also benefit from leveraging contemporary AI technologies, like those developed by HULO, which aid in real-time water management and waste reduction. For households, adopting water-saving habits, assisted by improved awareness, could significantly alleviate resource strains.",

      "new_information": "FrieslandCampina leads a 3-year regenerative agriculture pilot with 30 Dutch farms, targeting sustainability and soil health. Supported financially by supermarket chain Lidl and guided by the National Growth Fund program ReGeNL, these farms are charting a course towards a system centred on soil restoration, biodiversity, and sustainable income models. The initiative seeks to create a publicly accessible standard that measures the impact of practices like diverse grasslands and rotational grazing. By 2031, the vision is to swing 1,000 farmers towards this sustainable future. Regenerative agriculture is a holistic approach to farming that prioritises restoring natural ecosystems by improving soil health and biodiversity. This philosophy is centred around sustaining current land capabilities and enhancing them for future generations. Techniques such as cover cropping, rotational grazing, no-till farming, and composting are employed to sequester carbon, reduce reliance on synthetic inputs, and enhance soil fertility. Indigenous communities have used similar methods for centuries, recognising the interconnectedness of ecosystems and societal wellbeing. This approach addresses climate change by sequestering greenhouse gases and building resilience in agricultural lands, making soils more adept at withstanding floods and droughts. AI revolution in the greenhouse and livestock farming: smart technology is transforming horticulture With partners TU Delft, TU Eindhoven, and WUR, work is underway on AI-driven control systems for more efficient water and energy consumption in greenhouses and advanced monitoring of animal behavior. One key objective of the FrieslandCampina pilot project is to establish quantifiable standards for regenerative agriculture that can be applied widely. The project aims to track the impact of regenerative practices meticulously through data collection and analysis. This involves developing tailored farm plans in the first year and closely monitoring ecological and economic impacts in subsequent years. The ambition is not just to maintain environmental integrity but also to ensure that agricultural practices remain economically viable. By proving the effectiveness of these methods, FrieslandCampina hopes to inspire broader adoption across the agricultural sector. The FrieslandCampina project underscores the significance of partnerships in advancing regenerative agriculture. Cooperation along the supply chain, from financiers like Lidl to knowledge partners like ReGeNL, ensures that farmers receive comprehensive support. Lidl's marketing director, Erik van den Hoogen, emphasizes the shared responsibility to create a sustainable food system that benefits farmers, consumers, and the environment alike. This collaboration not only provides financial support but also reinforces the credibility and reach of the project, helping to transform today’s environmental challenges into tomorrow’s opportunities.",

This initiative seeks to strengthen Europe's position in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and military drones and to draw increased private investment, potentially unlocking €250 billion for the sector. EIB President Nadia Calviño emphasizes the bank's willingness to take more risks, notably speeding up the venture capital financing process, which could be pivotal for startups in a fast-moving market. The EIB plans to launch this initiative, dubbed TechEU, later this year, creating a centralized hub for financing requests from researchers and companies. This initiative aims to streamline the process, making EU funding processes faster and simpler. A quicker decision-making process can differentiate between the survival and failure of startups navigating tight cash flows and competitive markets. In an interview with German business newspaper Handelsblatt, Calviño has emphasized a newfound willingness to embrace risk within the EIB's financing strategies. The bank aims to process startup financing applications within six months, significantly improving from the current 18-month timespan. Calviño describes this accelerated timeline as a 'gamechanger,' pointing out that the high-paced nature of tech innovation requires nimble response times to keep up with market dynamics. Drawing on the current geopolitical landscape, Calviño sees the uncertainty generated by US President Donald Trump's economic policies as an opportunity for Europe. This environment increasingly attracts international investors interested in the stability and potential offered by the European market. The EIB aims to position itself as a beacon of stability and innovation, leveraging Europe's large market and academic prowess to bolster technological advancement. Furthermore, the EIB has prioritized defense and security within its portfolio, recognizing its synergies with technological advancements. This approach acknowledges that investments in these sectors can stimulate technological development and fortify Europe’s technological agenda. As the EIB funds projects across various tech domains, it develops a comprehensive ecosystem where tech innovation is both shielded and nurtured. With plans to co-invest with private investors, the EIB aspires to inspire confidence and mitigate risk through its backing, potentially catalyzing up to €250 billion in the European tech ecosystem. As the EIB awaits approval from the 27 EU finance ministers, this initiative underscores Europe's commitment to closing the innovation gap with the US and asserting its role as a global tech leader. The approval is expected to take place next month.",

      "new_information": "Social leasing schemes have the potential to help up to 3 million European low-income households switch to electric mobility by 2032. The French social leasing program, launched in December 2023, made electric vehicles (EVs) available for €49 to €150 per month, with over 90,000 applications received in a month and a half. The scheme, which only subsidized cars built in Europe, closed at the beginning of 2024 and is set to reopen later this year. The average age of the first 25,000 beneficiaries is around 40, 9 years younger than the average for EV purchasers in 2023, and 14 years younger than the average for buyers of new cars overall. T&E suggests that member states include social leasing in their National Social Climate Plans, funding it using the ETS2 revenues. This new carbon market makes polluters, such as fuel suppliers, pay. T&E assumed a €5,000 subsidy over a six-year period, estimating lease rents between €180 and €215 per month on a €25,000 EV. As €20,000 models are expected to hit the market in the coming two years, lower rates could be offered with the same subsidy level. This proposal takes into account a reduced 6% VAT rate and no deposit for the first rent, similar to the French scheme. The organization underlines how this subsidy scheme would reach 27% of low and medium-income households in rural areas. Moreover, if national schemes were to favor cars produced in Europe, local manufacturers could benefit. In addition, it could unlock demand in the smaller EV segments.",

Contributing to this achievement are the updated National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs), which outline strategies tailored to each member state's capacity and potential. Key to this progress are strategic initiatives such as the Clean Industrial Deal and the Affordable Energy Action Plan, designed to drive investments in industrial decarbonisation and clean technology. These initiatives are projected to leverage Europe's renewable potential and enhance energy efficiency, promoting a stable energy market. However, the journey is marked by uneven progress, as Belgium, Estonia, and Poland lag in submitting their final NECPs, underscoring the need for a unified and consistent approach among all member states. Renewable energy is poised to become the dominant source of electricity in the EU. The EU aims for a minimum 42.5% share of renewable energy by 2030, driven by NECPs and boosted by strategic EU-wide initiatives. This transformation is an economic catalyst. By integrating homegrown renewable resources, the EU is reducing dependency on imports and improving its energy security. Moreover, energy efficiency measures are expected to cut down overall energy wastage, optimising resource use. The EU's emissions have dropped by 37% since 1990, while the economy has expanded by nearly 70%.

This figure, independently verified and calculated using the EU's harmonized methodology, marks the highest-ever recycling rate for steel packaging. Steel recycling is an extensive process that begins with the collection of used steel products. Thanks to its properties, steel can be easily separated from waste streams using magnets, ensuring high purity levels for recycled material. Once collected, the steel is melted down in a furnace and cast into new products. This process is not only energy efficient, reducing the need for virgin raw material extraction, but also emits significantly lower levels of greenhouse gases. Remarkably, 100% of the recycled steel retains its quality, making it a prime candidate for a range of applications, from new packaging to infrastructure projects like trains or wind turbines. This milestone brings steel closer to closing the materials loop, contributing to the European Union's circular economy goals. By 2050, the EU aims to become a fully circular economy. The forthcoming new EU Circular Economy Act, which is expected to be implemented in 2026, is set to unify circular economy policies and prioritize sustainable access to critical raw materials.",

      "new_information": "Dr. Biljana Pesalj, Professor of Circular Transitions at Fontys University of Applied Sciences, emphasizes that sustainability reporting should be a roadmap to sustainable business and a new economy, not just a compliance task. She warns against treating sustainability reporting as an administrative obligation rather than a strategic compass. Pesalj argues that even green technologies can become part of the problem if not applied systemically, describing this as Greenwashing 2.0. She highlights the need for a shift from value extraction to value creation across entire value chains. Pesalj's research focuses on redefining the bottom line, moving from strategy to systems, and empowering people. She criticizes Brainport Eindhoven for treating sustainability as one of many priorities rather than the foundation for long-term resilience. Pesalj calls for national policymakers to link sustainability reporting to policy instruments, businesses to integrate sustainability into the boardroom, and regional ecosystems to embed circularity and social value into collaboration. She notes progress from companies like ASML and startups pioneering circular models, but cautions that these efforts must move from niche to norm.",

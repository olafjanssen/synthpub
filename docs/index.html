        <p class="subtitle">An AI Curated Digital Garden</p>
        <p>SynthPub reimagines <b>automated content publishing</b> by treating information as a carefully tended <b>digital garden</b> rather than an endless stream of new content. In an age of <b>information overload</b>, this platform takes a thoughtful approach to content synthesis and curation, focusing on <b>substance</b> over <b>information</b>.</p>

## AI-Human Collaboration

This project represents a true AI-human collaboration where AI tools are not just assistants but active participants in the development process. While human developers maintain final control and make critical decisions, the majority of the codebase and documentation is AI-generated and then refined through human review and modification.

## Part of The DPBTSE Initiative

SynthPub is developed as part of [The DPBTSE](https://dpbtse.com) (The Dead Philosophers Brainstorm To Solve Everything), a hybrid thinktank and creative studio-lab initiative at [Fontys ICT Innovation Lab](https://www.fontysictinnovationlab.nl/). The DPBTSE is an adventurous experiment that transcends traditional academic, artistic, and socio-economic boundaries by:

- Stimulating open-ended creativity and holistic thinking
- Integrating Arts, Science, and Philosophy
- Fostering collaboration between humans and AI
- Developing interdisciplinary approaches to 21st-century challenges

Through SynthPub, we embrace The DPBTSE's vision of exploring new intellectual and creative paradigms, particularly in how we handle and curate information in our digital age.

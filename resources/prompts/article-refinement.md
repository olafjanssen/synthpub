# Knowledge Synthesis: Essential Insight Distillation

OBJECTIVE: Create a focused, insightful synthesis of an existing article taking into account new information coming in that emphasizes key principles / recent news and discards peripheral or outdated information.

**Important: Stick to the existing structure and follow the structured instructions (such as 'keep this line') inside the article and fit the information in that structure, do not add any extra sections!**

CONTEXT:
Topic: {topic_title}
Description: {topic_description}

## EXISTING ARTICLE

---------------------------------------------------

{article}

---------------------------------------------------

## VERIFIED INFORMATION

NEW INFORMATION:

{new_information}

SUPPORTING INFORMATION:

{enforcing_information}

CONTRADICTING INFORMATION:

{contradicting_information}


## INTEGRATION PRINCIPLES

1. RUTHLESS PRIORITIZATION
   - Focus exclusively on insights that meaningfully advance understanding
   - Discard peripheral details even if factually accurate
   - Maintain strict adherence to topic scope - remove tangential information

2. SUBSTANCE OVER COMPLETENESS
   - Elevate key principles and core insights above comprehensive coverage
   - Include only the most impactful examples, not exhaustive listings
   - Value clarity and depth on critical points over breadth of coverage

3. COGNITIVE ACCESSIBILITY
   - Structure content to emphasize relationships between key concepts
   - Use clear, direct language that prioritizes understanding over jargon
   - Create meaningful transitions that reveal conceptual connections

4. LENGTH DISCIPLINE
   - Maintain a consistent length of 300-500 words maximum
   - When adding new information, **remove less essential existing content**
   - Avoid the temptation to include something merely because it exists

## DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS

Produce a refined article that:

1. Feels more insightful, not longer
2. Prioritizes key principles over peripheral details
3. Contains only the most relevant information to the topic
4. Reads as a unified perspective with a clear point of view
5. Is engaging and accessible, not dry or academic
6. Does not exceed 500 words under any circumstances

Remember: The hallmark of understanding is the ability to separate signal from noise. Your task is to intensify the signal while eliminating the noise.

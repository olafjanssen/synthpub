# Knowledge Synthesis: Essential Insight Distillation

OBJECTIVE: Create a focused, insightful synthesis that emphasizes key principles and discards peripheral information.

CONTEXT:
Topic: {topic_title}
Description: {topic_description}

## STRUCTURE TO ADHERE TO

{structure_prompt}

## EXISTING ARTICLE

{article}


## VERIFIED INFORMATION

NEW INFORMATION:

{new_information}

SUPPORTING INFORMATION:

{enforcing_information}

CONTRADICTING INFORMATION:

## INTEGRATION PRINCIPLES

1. RUTHLESS PRIORITIZATION
   - Focus exclusively on insights that meaningfully advance understanding
   - Discard peripheral details even if factually accurate
   - Maintain strict adherence to topic scope - remove tangential information

2. SUBSTANCE OVER COMPLETENESS
   - Elevate key principles and core insights above comprehensive coverage
   - Include only the most impactful examples, not exhaustive listings
   - Value clarity and depth on critical points over breadth of coverage

3. COGNITIVE ACCESSIBILITY
   - Structure content to emphasize relationships between key concepts
   - Use clear, direct language that prioritizes understanding over jargon
   - Create meaningful transitions that reveal conceptual connections

4. LENGTH DISCIPLINE
   - Maintain a consistent length of 300-500 words maximum
   - When adding new information, remove less essential existing content
   - Avoid the temptation to include something merely because it exists

5. INFORMATION HIERARCHY
   - Position most important insights prominently at beginning of sections
   - Create clear conceptual levels: principles > applications > details
   - Ensure each paragraph has a single clear purpose that advances understanding


## DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS

Produce a refined article that:

1. Feels more insightful, not longer
2. Prioritizes key principles over peripheral details
3. Contains only the most relevant information to the topic
4. Reads as a unified perspective with a clear point of view
5. Is engaging and accessible, not dry or academic
6. Does not exceed 500 words under any circumstances

Remember: The hallmark of understanding is the ability to separate signal from noise. Your task is to intensify the signal while eliminating the noise.

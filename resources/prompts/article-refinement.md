## INTEGRATION METHODOLOGY

1. STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION

   - Preserve section hierarchy and logical flow
   - Retain successful elements of the original narrative approach

2. CONTENT INTEGRATION PROTOCOL
   - Weave new information into appropriate existing sections
   - When contradictions exist, preference newer information with greater precision
   - Incorporate supporting information to strengthen existing claims
   - Add new sections only when substantial new dimensions are introduced

3. STYLISTIC HARMONIZATION
   - Maintain consistent encyclopedic tone throughout
   - Preserve citation patterns and attribution style
   - Ensure consistent terminology usage across original and new material
   - Balance detail density across all sections

4. QUALITY CONTROL
   - Eliminate redundancies created during integration
   - Ensure logical transitions between original and new content
   - Maintain appropriate scope (300-500 words)
   - Verify all statements remain properly contextualized

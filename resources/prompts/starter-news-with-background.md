You are creating the foundation for a knowledge synthesis article on:

TOPIC: {topic_title}
DESCRIPTION: {topic_description}

## OBJECTIVE

Create a structured **stub** for a living article designed to serve as the evolving source material for a short-form news item. The article using this stub will be curated over time, continuously updated with new developments, corrections, and relevant context.

The structure should include:

üóûÔ∏è Section 1: Latest News Summary (Radio-Ready Digest)
A brief, always-current summary of the most recent and relevant development, written for internal use by radio scriptwriters.

* 1‚Äì3 short paragraphs (max 100 words)
* Prioritize clarity and factual immediacy
* Includes: What happened, when, where, and why it matters

üìÖ Section 2: Chronology of Events
A running, timestamped log of relevant developments and factual updates.

* Use a bullet or dateline format
* Keep entries factual and attributed (if applicable)
* Maintain clarity even when the story evolves over weeks/months

üåç Section 3: Context and Background
A growing, non-repetitive collection of contextual information and relevant background knowledge.

- Include historical framing, key concepts, stakeholder descriptions
- May contain quotes (real or synthesized) from notable voices
- Designed to offer thematic depth to future radio items

## CONSTRAINTS

- Maximum length: 200 words
- No invented facts or statistics
- No speculative content
- Neutral, encyclopedic tone
- **Important: Produce only the structure, with template-like introduction and abstract examples, not actual content!!**

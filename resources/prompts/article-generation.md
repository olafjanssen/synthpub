# Knowledge Synthesis: Initial Article Framework

You are creating the foundation for a knowledge synthesis article on:

TOPIC: {topic_title}
DESCRIPTION: {topic_description}

## OBJECTIVE
Create a structured framework for an authoritative, neutral article that:
- Defines the core concept precisely
- Identifies key aspects requiring coverage
- Establishes logical organization for future content

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
1. Title: Create a precise, informative title (not just the topic name)
2. Introduction: 2-3 sentences defining the topic and its significance
3. Section Structure: 3-5 H2 headings that:
   - Cover distinct aspects of the topic
   - Follow a logical progression
   - Are named using standard terminology
4. Placeholders: For each section, include 1-2 sentences outlining:
   - What information belongs in this section
   - What questions should be answered
   - What aspects require factual substantiation
5. Format: Standard Markdown with proper heading hierarchy

## CONSTRAINTS
- Maximum length: 300 words
- No invented facts or statistics
- No speculative content
- Focus on structure, not detailed content
- Neutral, encyclopedic tone

This framework will be iteratively expanded with verified information from multiple sources.

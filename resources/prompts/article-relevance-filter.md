## ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK

1. INFORMATION VALUE ANALYSIS
   - Does the source contain factual content absent from the existing article?
   - Does it provide quantitative data, specific examples, or detailed explanations?
   - Does it introduce important perspectives, applications, or implications?
   - Does it offer temporal context (historical development or future directions)?

2. QUALITY EVALUATION
   - Is the information specific rather than general?
   - Does it add precision to existing statements?
   - Does it provide domain-specific terminology or frameworks?
   - Does it correct, update, or refine existing content?

3. CONTEXTUAL RELEVANCE
   - Does it directly address the core topic or only tangentially relate?
   - Does it expand understanding of topics already identified as important?
   - Does it fill gaps explicitly noted in the existing article?
   - Does it address aspects of the topic description not yet covered?

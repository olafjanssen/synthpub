# Knowledge Synthesis: Information Extraction Protocol

OBJECTIVE: Systematically identify new, supporting, and contradictory information between existing content and new sources.

CONTEXT:
Topic: {topic_title}
Description: {topic_description}

## EXISTING ARTICLE

{article}

## NEW SOURCE

{new_context}

## EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY

1. UNIQUE INFORMATION IDENTIFICATION
   - Extract discrete facts, concepts, and details present ONLY in the new source
   - Each point should represent a single, atomic unit of information
   - Prioritize verifiable, objective statements over interpretations
   - Consider dates, quantities, attributions, relationships, and definitions

2. CORROBORATIVE INFORMATION ANALYSIS
   - Identify statements that substantiate existing article claims
   - Note specific textual evidence indicating agreement
   - Evaluate if new source provides stronger evidence or examples
   - Identify when new source offers additional context that strengthens existing points

3. CONTRADICTORY INFORMATION ASSESSMENT
   - Pinpoint direct factual conflicts between sources
   - Specify the exact nature of each contradiction
   - Determine if contradictions stem from:
     * Temporal differences (outdated vs. current information)
     * Perspective differences (equally valid alternative viewpoints)
     * Definitional variations (differences in how terms are understood)
     * Factual errors (demonstrably incorrect statements)
